# Qbus MQTT for Java

This repository consists of useful modules for Java integrations with Qbus over MQTT.  
The setup of Qbus' qbusmqtt tool or the MQTT broker are not in scope of this repository.  
These modules are currently not publicly deployed anywhere.

## Qbus MQTT Model

This module holds Java representations of objects used in data sent and received from Qbus MQTT messages.

## Qbus MQTT for Spring

This module provides Spring components for interacting with an MQTT broker which Qbus is producing to and consuming from.

It uses the Eclipse Paho client for interaction with the MQTT broker.
